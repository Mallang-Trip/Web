          "I booked this thinking it would be perfect for my elderly parents. The driver explained about Jeju, matched our walking pace, and took great care of us. The restaurant recommendation was amazing - Jeju beef (I'd heard of Jeju black pork but never Jeju beef, and it was much cheaper and tastier than mainland beef!). Both my mom and I were completely satisfied. Mom wants to meet the driver again when she comes back with friends!",

          "It was our first trip to Jeju with my friend, and I was worried about language barriers. The driver used AI translation, which made communication really smooth - the technology was amazing. Most importantly, they were consistently kind and warm to us throughout the trip, which made our hearts warm. Thanks to the driver, we're returning home with only good memories of Jeju. Thank you!",
